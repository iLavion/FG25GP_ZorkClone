# FG25GP_ZorkClone

[![CI](https://github.com/iLavion/FG25GP_ZorkClone/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iLavion/FG25GP_ZorkClone/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This might genuinely be the most loved project I've done in awhile and I plan on continuing to use this as a foundation for a new game that will be more free in terms of gameplay... although in Rust. The new project will be available [here](https://github.com/PastelleStudios/Adelgard).
